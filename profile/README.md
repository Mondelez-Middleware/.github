# Welcome to Mondelez-Middleware

This private GitHub organization is part of the Mondelez enterprise. If you are seeing this page, you are not a member of the organization (or are not currently authenticated.). See below for requesting organization access

## Requesting Access

### Prequisites

- You must have a Mondelez International user account
- You must have a GitHub account. This can be an existing account, or one that you create specifically for use in this organization.
- You must link your Mondelez email address [to your GitHub Account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-email-preferences/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account).
  - If you have an `@mdlz.com` email address, use it for this step.
  - Some contractors may not have an `@mdlz.com` email account. Emails related to their Mondelez user account are sent to a third-party email address instead. In this scenario, that email must be used.

### Submit Request and Join Organization

1. Go to **Access Center**
2. In *Manage User Access*, request the `Mondelez Middleware Github Access` entitlement for your account and submit the request.
3. After your request is approved, you will receive an email invitation to join the organization. This will be sent from [noreply@github.com](noreply@github.com) with the subject line: `@MDLZGithub has invited you to join the @Mondelez-Middleware organization`
4. Click `Join @Mondelez-Middlware`, and follow the prompts to authenticate to Mondelez SSO and link your account to the GitHub organization.
